# Clock
A simple Python clock I made, will update later. Feel free to do what you want to do, given it's nothing illegal ofc.  Apologies if some of the code is messy.

The clock is fully coded in Python, and therefore you'll require Python to run it. It's possible to compile it too, and you can alternatively run an .exe file of it too.
Like stated before, this code may be really messy. In the future I'll improve it but for now it's a good start. It does the job, so personally I'm not that bothered.
